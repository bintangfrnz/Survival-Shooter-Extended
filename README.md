## Description

**Survival Shooter** is a game where players have to survive the zombies' attacks. This game is available on the [Unity Learn platform](https://learn.unity.com/project/survival-shooter-tutorial) for anyone to learn. In this assignment, I continue my work on Unity Exercise based on the [Survival Shooter Tutorial - 1 of 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lP6epjupJs&list=PL871udVFq7OF9w5RBjyp_lcyzFuViLe8x&index=2) video and continue the game built by [@PrateekAdhikaree](https://github.com/PrateekAdhikaree) with his permission. You can check the repository here:

There are 3 main player attributes in this game. Here's the stats:

### (2) Orbs and Pickups
<img src="https://github.com/bintangfrnz/Survival-Shooter-Extended/blob/main/Pictures/Gif_orbs.gif?raw=true" alt="Orbs" width="600">

In this game, we have 3 orbs to **increase the value of each player attribute** and 3 pickups to **enhance weapon within a certain time** that the player can pick up and will disappear if not taken in 10 seconds.

- **Player Attribute Orbs**

Orbs will appear randomly every 3 seconds with 40% chance of spawning.<br>
`50%` -> health orb<br>
`25%` -> speed orb<br>
`25%` -> power orb<br>

|       | Power | Speed  | Health |
| :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: |
| Color | blue  | yellow | red    |
| Add   | 2     | 0.25   | 15     |

- **Enhance Weapon Pickups**

Pickups will appear on the enemy dead body with 25% chance of spawning.<br>
`40%` -> floating pickup<br>
`35%` -> bouncing pickup<br>
`25%` -> piercing pickup<br>

|             | Bounce | Pierce  | Float |
| :---------: | :----: | :-----: | :---: |
| Color       | green  | magenta | white |
| time effect | 20s    | 20s     | 20s   |

  - **bounce**: bullets can bounce while they hit the environment, but not the enemies<br>
  - **pierce**: bullets can pierce through the enemies, but not the environment<br>
  - **float**: bullets can float further (bullet floating time becomes longer)<br>

### (3) Additional Mobs
